This fork of [Esrille New Keyboard](https://github.com/esrille/new-keyboard) aims at replacing the Dvorak, Colemak and Japanese original layouts by european keyboards layouts.
The following layouts are planned:
 - Azerty
 - BÃ©po
 
 
A few other modifications regarding the non-alphanumeric keys are also planned:
 - Replace 'Caps Lock' by 'Del'
 - Move 'Insert' closer to the center (used by Resharper and Mintty)
 - Find a better use than F13-F14 for fn+B, fn+N
 - Find a way to perform an Alt+Shift+arrow combo (used to make rectangular selection)
 - Find a way to perform a Ctrl+Alt+Shift+arrow combo (used to move things around in Resharper, Notepad++)
